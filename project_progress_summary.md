**Features Implemented**:
1. **AI Cell Insight Enhancement**:
   - Context-aware analysis based on column descriptions
   - Performance assessment (EXCELLENT/POOR/AVERAGE) based on user descriptions
   - Smart interpretation of "lower is better" vs "higher is better" scenarios
   - Percentile positioning and statistical context

2. **Selection-Based Calculations**:
   - Row range selection for specific calculations
   - Multiple calculation types: Mean, Sum, Count, Min, Max, Standard Deviation
   - Real-time results for selected data ranges

3. **Column Setup Enhancement**:
   - Display names for columns (user-friendly labels)
   - Hidden descriptions for AI analysis (detailed context for better insights)

## Current Application Features

### Filtering System
- **Categorical Filtering**: Checkbox-based filtering for text columns
  - Example: Group column with "Control (10)" and "Treatment (11)" checkboxes
  - Quick "All/Clear" buttons for each column
- **Numeric Filtering**: Range sliders for numeric columns
- **Filter Summary**: Clear display of "Showing X of Y rows (Z hidden)"

### Statistical Analysis
- **Available Tests**: Descriptive Statistics, T-Test, ANOVA, Regression, Correlation
- **Test Selection**: Multi-select interface with prominent "Run Analysis" button
- **Results Display**: Expandable sections for each test with detailed results

### AI-Powered Features
1. **Cell Value Analysis**:
   - Select any column and value for analysis
   - Context-aware performance assessment
   - Percentile positioning and statistical interpretation
   - Smart assessment based on column descriptions (e.g., "lower scores = better")

2. **Statistical Insights**: 
   - Overall analysis of statistical results
   - Recommendations based on data patterns
   - Significance interpretation

### Selection & Calculation Tools
- **Row Range Selection**: Choose specific rows for analysis
- **Column-Specific Calculations**: Focus on individual columns
- **Multiple Calculation Types**: Statistical operations on selected data
- **Real-Time Results**: Immediate feedback on calculations

### Visualization

### Backend Modules
- **DataManager**: File loading, data cleaning, column descriptions
- **StatisticalAnalyzer**: All statistical computations and hypothesis testing
- **AIInsights**: OpenAI integration for generating insights
- **Visualizations**: Chart creation and data visualization

### AI Integration
- **Model**: OpenAI GPT-4o (latest model as of May 2024)
- **Features**: Context-aware analysis, performance assessment, statistical interpretation
- **Input**: Column descriptions, statistical results, data context
- **Output**: Structured insights with key findings and recommendations

## Key User Preferences Discovered
1. **Communication Style**: Simple, everyday language (non-technical)
2. **Filtering Preference**: Column-by-column with clear value counts
3. **Analysis Needs**: Cell-level insights with context understanding
4. **Calculation Requirements**: Selection-based statistical operations
5. **Description System**: Hidden technical descriptions for AI, friendly display names for UI
